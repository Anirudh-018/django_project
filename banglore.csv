           From an historic, 19th century arsenal to a converted, landmark power plant, all of athenahealth’s offices were carefully chosen to represent our innovative spirit and promote the most positive and productive work environment for our teams. Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.
           
           Our company culture might be our best feature.
           We don't take ourselves too seriously. But our work? That’s another story. athenahealth develops and implements products and services that support US healthcare: It’s our chance to create healthier futures for ourselves, for our family and friends, for everyone.
         
        
        
        
         
           Our vibrant and talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our goal. We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.
         
        
        
        
         
           Our size makes a difference, too: We are small enough that your individual contributions will stand out — but large enough to grow your career with our resources and established business stability.
           
           Giving back is integral to our culture. Our athenaGives platform strives to support food security, expand access to high-quality healthcare for all, and support STEM education to develop providers and technologists who will provide access to high-quality healthcare for all in the future. As part of the evolution of athenahealth’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, we’ve selected nonprofit partners that align with our purpose and let us foster long-term partnerships for charitable giving, employee volunteerism, insight sharing, collaboration, and cross-team engagement.
         
        
        
        
         
           What can we do for you?
           Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy perks specific to each location, including commuter support, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee resource groups, and collaborative workspaces — some offices even welcome dogs.
         
        
        
        
         
           In addition to our traditional benefits and perks, we sponsor events throughout the year, including book clubs, external speakers, and hackathons. And we provide athenistas with a company culture based on learning, the support of an engaged team, and an inclusive environment where all employees are valued.
         
        
        
        
         
           We also encourage a better work-life balance for athenistas with our flexibility. While we know in-office collaboration is critical to our vision, we recognize that not all work needs to be done within an office environment, full-time. With consistent communication and digital collaboration tools, athenahealth enables employees to find a balance that feels fulfilling and productive for each individual situation.",https://www.indeed.co.in/rc/clk?jk=3728c4ddf895d6fe&from=jasx&tk=1hddmt8sojgaa804&vjs=3,

 Our Company 

 Changing the world through digital experiences is what Adobe’s all about. We give everyone—from emerging artists to global brands—everything they need to design and deliver exceptional digital experiences. We’re passionate about empowering people to craft beautiful and powerful images, videos, and apps, and transform how companies interact with customers across every screen. 

 We’re on a mission to hire the very best and are committed to creating exceptional employee experiences where everyone is respected and has access to equal opportunity. We realize that new ideas can come from everywhere in the organization, and we know the next big idea could be yours. 

 The Opportunity 

 Do you thrive on solving hard problems at scale? Do you want to build cloud-native systems that work seamlessly across devices? Are you interested in defining the future of creativity by making it fast, fun, and frictionless to create sophisticated-looking content? Most of all, are you passionate about the next generation of users and building modern solutions for them that connect to leading social and digital platforms? 

 We believe that a modern design tool should be lightweight and easy to use, with low friction and amazing performance. We are reimagining the creative process powered through a highly collaborative experience that works seamlessly across multiple surfaces. 

 The challenge 

 We are seeking an experienced Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to join our team of talented developers. You have to be very knowledgeable in patterns for infrastructure services, highly available systems and scalable web architectures. 

 Our Site Reliability Engineers work hand-in hand with a growing team of hardworking engineers, building out a new platform critical to Adobe’s effort to reimaging a highly collaborative creative process. SREs provide operational tooling and engineering support to create reliable, quick, and transparent services and supporting infrastructure. 

 A capable Site Reliability Engineer should have one main high-level objective : identify and solve complex problems through software. This is not a traditional sysadmin/operations role ( i.e. deployments, ticket work, dashboarding, monitoring, incident response). A significant portion of time (~50%) will be some form of programming/development work, preferably to solve self-identified problems. 

 If you’re looking to be part of a team that is building the future of design tools, welcome to Creative Cloud. 

 
What you will do:
 Ensure the highest level of uptime and Quality of Service (QoS) to Adobe’s customers through operational excellence 

 Embed with product teams to champion collaboration/partnership 

 Identify areas to improve service resiliency through techniques such as chaos engineering, performance/load testing, etc 

 Support and maintain globally distributed, multi-cloud (public and/or private) environments 

 Automate common, repeatable tasks at large scale to streamline operational procedures 

 Design and maintain production monitoring systems 

 Identify and solve performance and stability issues using a variety of tools 

 Evaluate and manage application and environment security 

 Follow organizational change processes during implementations 

 Use and maintain version control for application infrastructure 

 Cross-train with other global team members 

 Participate in an on-call rotation as required 

 Determine root-cause for all production level incidents and write corresponding high-quality RCA reports 

 Promote the DevOps/SRE mindset 

 
What you need to succeed :
 5+ years production level experience with distributed applications at scale in public cloud (AWS and/or Azure) 

 Production level expertise with Docker, containerization orchestration engines ( i.e. Kubernetes) 

 Good experience in building and managing infrastructure on AWS cloud using various AWS services (EC2, IAM, S3, Route53, Cloudfront , SQS, EBS, KMS, Cloudwatch etc )

           Here’s our vision: To create a thriving ecosystem that delivers accessible, high-quality, and sustainable healthcare for all.
         
         
         
           What’s unique about our locations?
           From an historic, 19th century arsenal to a converted, landmark power plant, all of athenahealth’s offices were carefully chosen to represent our innovative spirit and promote the most positive and productive work environment for our teams. Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.
           
           Our company culture might be our best feature.
           We don't take ourselves too seriously. But our work? That’s another story. athenahealth develops and implements products and services that support US healthcare: It’s our chance to create healthier futures for ourselves, for our family and friends, for everyone.
         
        
        
        
         
           Our vibrant and talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our goal. We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.
         
        
        
        
         
           Our size makes a difference, too: We are small enough that your individual contributions will stand out — but large enough to grow your career with our resources and established business stability.
           
           Giving back is integral to our culture. Our athenaGives platform strives to support food security, expand access to high-quality healthcare for all, and support STEM education to develop providers and technologists who will provide access to high-quality healthcare for all in the future. As part of the evolution of athenahealth’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, we’ve selected nonprofit partners that align with our purpose and let us foster long-term partnerships for charitable giving, employee volunteerism, insight sharing, collaboration, and cross-team engagement.
         
        
        
        
         
           What can we do for you?
           Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy perks specific to each location, including commuter support, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee resource groups, and collaborative workspaces — some offices even welcome dogs.
         
        
        
        
         
           In addition to our traditional benefits and perks, we sponsor events throughout the year, including book clubs, external speakers, and hackathons. And we provide athenistas with a company culture based on learning, the support of an engaged team, and an inclusive environment where all employees are valued.
         
        
        
        
         
           We also encourage a better work-life balance for athenistas with our flexibility. While we know in-office collaboration is critical to our vision, we recognize that not all work needs to be done within an office environment, full-time. With consistent communication and digital collaboration tools, athenahealth enables employees to find a balance that feels fulfilling and productive for each individual situation.",https://www.indeed.co.in/rc/clk?jk=f2814e097ab4739f&from=jasx&tk=1hddmv0atj30v800&vjs=3,
